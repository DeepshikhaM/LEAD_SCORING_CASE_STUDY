# Lead-Scoring-Analysis
This project aims to optimize lead conversion for X Education, an online course provider. With a vast number of leads generated daily through various marketing channels, identifying high-potential leads ("Hot Leads") is crucial for improving conversion rates and enhancing sales efficiency.

🎯 Problem Statement
X Education acquires hundreds of leads daily, but only 30% convert into paying customers.
Many leads drop off during the nurturing stage due to the lack of interest or poor engagement.
The goal is to develop a Machine Learning model to predict the likelihood of lead conversion and prioritize high-value leads.


📂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of approximately 9000 data points with various features such as:
- Lead Source (Organic, Paid Ads, Referral)
-  Total Time Spent on Website
- Total Visits
- Last Activity (Email Opened, Phone Call Answered)
- Converted (Target Variable: 1 = Converted, 0 = Not Converted)

🎯 Project Goals
✅ Build a Logistic Regression Model to predict lead conversion probability (0-100%)
✅ Rank leads based on conversion likelihood to prioritize high-potential customers
✅ Improve sales targeting by focusing on hot leads rather than cold outreach
✅ Provide business insights to optimize marketing efforts

🛠 Tech Stack
🔹 Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
🔹 Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Feature Engineering
🔹 Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
🔹 Development Tools: Jupyter Notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📊 Expected Results
✔ A well-commented Jupyter Notebook with ML model implementation
✔ Lead scoring predictions (0-100%) to rank customers based on conversion probability
✔ A final presentation summarizing findings and business impact
✔ Data-driven recommendations for optimizing lead nurturing

🔹 Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Lead-Scoring-Analysis.git

- Run the Jupyter Notebook for EDA and Model Training
